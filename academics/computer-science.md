Our BS in ACS (BACS) program is an accelerated degree programm with study the applied computer science through hands on project based learning.   To earn a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Applied Computer Science, students must complete a total of 124 units, 48 of which must be upper-division, in the areas of Software Product Development, Technical and Science & Letters.  
- **Software Product Development Curriculum includes:**
  - **Software Product Development Term Courses (SPD)** are project focused courses where students integrate the content from technical courses and learn valuable career skills. These courses are offered and must be taken every term. 
  - **Intensives (INT)** are one to two week long immersive courses where students work individually or on teams to build products.  Intensives are offered in between terms three times a year in Fall, Winter and Spring
