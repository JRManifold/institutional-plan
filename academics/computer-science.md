## Bachelor of Science Applied Computer Science
Our BS in ACS (BACS) program is an accelerated degree program with studies applied computer science through hands-on project based learning.   To earn a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Applied Computer Science, students must complete a total of 124 units, 48 of which must be upper-division, in the areas of Software Product Development, Technical and Science & Letters.  
- **Software Product Development Curriculum includes:**
  - **Software Product Development Term Courses (SPD)** are project focused courses where students integrate the content from technical courses and learn valuable career skills. These courses are offered and must be taken every term.
  - **Intensives (INT)** are one to two week long immersive courses where students work individually or on teams to build products.  Intensives are offered in between terms three times a year in Fall, Winter and Spring
  - **Supervised Work Experience (SWE)** is a semester long internship with an industry partner. Students must apply for these positions at verified companies and are mentored by the company.  These are often paid positions.
- **Technical Curriculum includes:**
  - **Foundational Curriculum:**  Computer Science: CS 1.0, CS 1.1, and CS 1.2, and Full Stack Web: WEB 1.0 and WEB 1.1.
  - **Concentration Curriculum:**  There are four concentrations: Back End Web (BEW), Front End Web (FEW), Mobile (MOB), Data Science (DS). Students will take 6 courses in their concentration.  Students can choose not to have a concentration and take 6 additional technical electives.
  - **Electives:** Courses chosen from any concentration, advanced CS (CS 1.3, CS 2.1, CS 2.2), independent studies, and advanced technical seminars.
- **Science & Letters Curriculum includes:**
  - Courses covering a broad spectrum of learning in writing, quantitative literacy, science and social science.  These courses are often offered over a semester (two terms).   See more in the Science & Letters Section.


### Curriculum Changes
Course schedule changes:
- The schedule for when classes are offered each term is determined based on the hours the class needs to be in session (5.5 hours per week for a 3 unit course in 7 weeks) and optimizing for student, instructor, community schedules.  The list of courses offered each term is determined on a year to year basis and published here: [make.sc/course-schedule](http://make.sc/course-schedule).  Each term, we evaluate if any additional courses are needed for our students and (when possible) offer these courses as well.  Occasionally a course that doesn't have enough enrollment will be moved to a later term.

Course changes:
- For fall 2020, we updated our foundational curriculum to include CS 1.0 Introduction to Programming and WEB 1.0 Web Fundamentals to provide a better onboarding into our program for students with no previous programming experience.  High pass rates in Term 1 indicate this was a successful change that will increase student success.
