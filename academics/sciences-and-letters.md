### Framework for Make School Science & Letters
**Rational:** Make Schoolâ€™s general education program aims to develop our students into well rounded and engaged citizens.

   Our curriculum uses the lenses of Self, Community, and World to help students develop agency, embody a growth mindset, learn to solve impactful problems, and engage in their communities. Our courses are project-based, interdisciplinary, connected to real-world phenomenon, and emphasize character development.

**Implementation:** Make School S&L is 30 units offered as 10 3-unit courses. It is comprised of 9 courses that fall into three categories representing the scope of impact; Self, Community, World; and a single 3-unit capstone course that synthesizes S&L learning. All courses meet at least one of the 4 WASC Core Competencies: written and oral communication, quantitative reasoning, information literacy, and critical thinking .
