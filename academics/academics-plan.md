## Updates - Spring 2020: Please see instittutional planning process for information on why and how these decisons are made. 
Based on the projected incomming student number of 200-250 incomming juniors and 100 returning seniors we will scale academics for Fall 2020 in the following ways: 
### Instructors: 
The number of instructors is based on four key factors:
   - Course Caps: 50 for SPD classes , 30 for junior classes (level 1.X), 20 for senior classes (level 2.X)
   - Instructor teaching load: max of 3 classes per term
   - Course Schedule: which courses/concentrations are offered each term 
   - Number of students 
The sections needed for the entire year are planned based on this data and then the number and type of instructors needed to hire is determined.
