# Academics

### Staff area owner and author: Anne Spalding (Dean)

## Updates - Spring 2020:

**(Please see the institutional planning process for information on why and how these decisions are made. )**

Based on the projected incoming student number of 200-250 incoming juniors and 100 returning seniors we will scale academics for Fall 2020 in the following ways:
### Instructors:
The number of instructors is based on four key factors:
   - Course Caps: 50 for SPD classes , 30 for junior classes (level 1.X), 20 for senior classes (level 2.X)
   - Instructor teaching load: max of 3 classes per term
   - Course Schedule: which courses/concentrations are offered each term
   - Number of students

The sections needed for the entire year are planned based on this data and then the number and type of instructors needed to hire is determined.   

**Projected # New Instructors 2020: 5-9 Technical, 2 S&L  | Total Technical Instructors 14-18 ~ Instructor:Student Ratio  1:18**

## Student facing staff headcount + mental health staff
Similar to scaling instructors, other student facing roles will also scale with the number of students.  
- Roles such as student coordinator will scale directly (ie double # students = double # coordinators).
- We will hire a full time mental health counselor in spring 2020 and have this plus possibly online and off campus resources available for fall 2020.

**Projected # New Student Experience Coordinators 2020: 2  | Total SE Coordinators:  4, Mental Health : 1 Full Time**

## Curriculum Changes
Course schedule changes:
- The schedule for when classes are offered each term is determined based on the hours the class needs to be in session (5.5 hours per week for a 3 unit course in 7 weeks) and trying to optimize for student, instructor, community, and building schedules.  
- This summer we will be running S&L classes twice a week to fit into the 7 week term and will experiment with shorter MWF classes and longer TTh classes.  We may also run an evening course or offer an S&L course online.  This will be determined once the summer schedule is set (early April).
- Next fall we will need to run additional sections and we will use what we learn from running courses in the summer to best determine how to do this.  We are currently evaluating the final building remodel to understand the number of course sections we will be able to offer in any time slot.

Course load updates:
- Due to incomming juniors not having any transfer S&L we are currently allowing students who are succeeding in courses to take a course load of 5 courses per term (instead of 4).  This seems to be working so will likely be continued to next year.


Track changes:
- For fall 2020 we will run the current curriculum with the MOB, BEW, FEW, DS Tracks.  We have revisited our foundation courses to make these both more accessible to incoming students without prior programming knowledge and to allow students who do have prior knowledge to take diagnostic exams to waive entry level courses.
- In late fall, early spring we will begin exploring additional tracks or course delivery methods.

 ## Science & Letters
 Make School is designing the framework for our Science and Letters program and what it will look like  once we are independently accredited and no longer in partnership with DU (2- 3 years).  During the next 2-3 years we will be iteratively building out our Science and Letters program while still adhering to the General Education requirements of DU.

### Framework for Make School Science & Letters
**Rational:** Make Schoolâ€™s general education program aims to develop our students into well rounded and engaged citizens.

   Our curriculum uses the lenses of Self, Community, and World to help students develop agency, embody a growth mindset, learn to solve impactful problems, and engage in their communities. Our courses are project-based, interdisciplinary, connected to real-world phenomenon, and emphasize character development.

**Implementation:** Make School S&L is 30 units offered as 10 3-unit courses. It is comprised of 9 courses that fall into three categories representing the scope of impact; Self, Community, World; and a single 3-unit capstone course that synthesizes S&L learning. All courses meet at least one of the 4 WASC Core Competencies: written and oral communication, quantitative reasoning, information literacy, and critical thinking .

 **Timeline:**
    - Spring 2020: Make School creates General Education Framework (S&L) and plan for integration with DU CORE andhires 2 S&L faculty to teach S&L sections full time onsite.
   - Fall 2020 - Spring 2021: Courses are delivered in both the 15 week and 7 week format as works best with course material and faculty availability.  
  - Fall 2020: Make School proposes 4 new courses that meet DU CORE category requirements and MS S&L framework.
  - Fall 2021-Spring 2021 Make School hires additional S&L faculty to meet incoming student needs.  Courses delivered are a blend of DU CORE(5) and MS S&L (4)
  - Fall 2021: Make School proposes 5 new courses that meet DU CORE category requirements and MS S&L framework. If approved these will be delivered in Fall 2022.
   - Fall 2022 - Spring 2023: Make School hires additional faculty to meet 100% of S&L needs


## Coaching / Mentorship
We are currently exploring how to implement coaching and mentorship with more students on site.  We recognize that 1:1 connections are vital to student success and are committed to retaining these in significant, value adding ways.
