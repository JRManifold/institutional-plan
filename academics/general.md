## Updates - Term 1, 2020:

### Student Body:
This fall we welcomed 108 new juniors along with 103 returning seniors and 29 super seniors for a total student body of 240 students.  

** Add in retention & demographic stats**


### Faculty:
The number of instructors is based on four key factors:
   - Course Caps: 50 for SPD classes , 30 for junior classes (level 1.X), 20 for senior classes (level 2.X)
   - Instructor teaching load: max of 3 classes per term
   - Course Schedule: which courses/concentrations are offered each term
   - Number of students

For the 2021 school year we currently have 10 full-time techincal faculty and 1 open full-time techinical roles.  We also have 2 full-time S&L facutly and 7 part-time S&L faculty.  The full-time faculty / studnet ratio will be 13 / 240 ~ 1 / 18 which is well within our goal of 1/20.


### Student Life
The student life team is currently made up of two Student Experience Coordinators, one Residence Life Coordinator and the Director of Student Life.  We are hiring an additional Student Experience and D&I Coordinator this term.  

Mental health has been outsourced to the online BetterHelp program which is free for all studnets.  

Our student-expereince coordinators / student ratio is 3 / 240 = 1/ 80 which is significantly lower than most colleges.


## Curriculum Changes
Course schedule changes:
- The schedule for when classes are offered each term is determined based on the hours the class needs to be in session (5.5 hours per week for a 3 unit course in 7 weeks) and trying to optimize for student, instructor, community, and building schedules.  

# NOT UPDATED YET
- Next fall we will need to run additional sections and we will use what we learn from running courses in the summer to best determine how to do this.  We are currently evaluating the final building remodel to understand the number of course sections we will be able to offer in any time slot.

Course load updates:
- Due to incomming juniors not having any transfer S&L we are currently allowing students who are succeeding in courses to take a course load of 5 courses per term (instead of 4).  This seems to be working so will likely be continued to next year.


Track changes:
- For fall 2020 we will run the current curriculum with the MOB, BEW, FEW, DS Tracks.  We have revisited our foundation courses to make these both more accessible to incoming students without prior programming knowledge and to allow students who do have prior knowledge to take diagnostic exams to waive entry level courses.
- In late fall, early spring we will begin exploring additional tracks or course delivery methods.

 ## Science & Letters
 Make School is designing the framework for our Science and Letters program and what it will look like  once we are independently accredited and no longer in partnership with DU (2- 3 years).  During the next 2-3 years we will be iteratively building out our Science and Letters program while still adhering to the General Education requirements of DU.



## Coaching / Mentorship
We are currently exploring how to implement coaching and mentorship with more students on site.  We recognize that 1:1 connections are vital to student success and are committed to retaining these in significant, value adding ways.
