# Student Life

*Area owner and author: Michelle Blackburn (Director of Student and Academic Affairs)*

## School wide-events (All Hands, Demo Night, Town Hall):

We are currently exploring  how to better deliver information and communicate with students, including All Hands and Town Halls. For the next year, we plan on hosting All Hands at the beginning of each term, and per student recommendation, we will offer Town Halls on an ad-hoc basis and will be focused on a specific subject matter. We may also consider developing a Town Hall calendar in which community members can vote on topics to be covered. We are still exploring what Demo Night will look like moving forward, but are considering hosting more frequent events for subsets of the student body, and having students provide potential employers with virtual demos and pitches.

Over the next 2-3 years, as we grow, we recognize that being able to physically hold all of our students in one location for All Hands and Town Halls. Therefore, we may need to subdivide students into smaller groups or provide students with the option of attending these events remotely. We believe there is intrinsic value in having our student community on-site for these events and do not want to lose the opportunity for students to regularly come together. We are also concerned that providing remote attendance options may also decrease student participation and effective communication from Make School to students. We are curious as to what students think could be viable solutions for School-wide events as we grow.

## Security (training staff, safety communication to students):

Over the next 2-3 years, we will enhance our security protocol in regards to access
control, staff training, and communication to students for both Main Campus and 851. Enhancements include adding more secured desk hours for 851, as well as improving video surveillance for all outside access points (e.g. backyard and patio). For all new housing options, Make School will vet the property for security, including access control, neighborhood and desk security (if applicable). For Main Campus, we anticipate introducing a “badging-in” policy as our community grows and being able to visually identify students and staff becomes more challenging.

On an annual basis, we will train staff on our security and emergency protocols, including how to respond to security breaches. This will also be incorporated into the onboarding process for all new staff and instructors.

We are currently in the process of developing an “Emergency” page on our website in which students, staff, and their families can receive updates on and emergencies that may impact our campus, including 851. All community members are encouraged to sign up for our text alert system in which they can receive live-time emergency and security updates.

## Health insurance:

We are aware that this is a significant need for many of our students and are actively working to determine how to better support students in having access to health care. We will soon be assigning a staff member to take on this project and explore both short-term and long-term solutions. As of right now, we want to better understand why students are not qualifying for MediCal and determine if we need to change the terms of the ISA model to allow students to utilize this option. Once we better understand why students are not able to access in the present, we will better be able to create a 2-3 year plan to address this issue. Our ultimate goal is to have 100% of our students have regular access to health care.

## Meal plans:

We recognize that food insecurity is an issue for many Make School students. We want to be able to creatively address this issue moving forward, but at the present time, there is no plan to offer a meal plan. Providing a meal plan will require securing and contracting a food services vendor, installing a commercial grade kitchen onsite, and securing the appropriate food service permits and licensing form the City, which must be maintained on semi-annual to annual basis.

Whereas at this time providing a meal plan is both cost and logistically prohibitive, we do hope to be able to explore this option as we grow our enrollment and potentially expand to other properties.

## Supporting underrepresented communities (women, LGBTQA, ethnic minorities):

This summer, we will be hiring a new Student Experience Team Member whose sole focus will be to develop programming and support underrepresented student communities. Over the next 2-3 years, we hope to bring on more staff members who have this area of expertise and can help us grow our support mechanism for these student groups. We are also focusing our efforts on enrolling more students from underrepresented communities and have that reflected in our staff hires. As part of our accreditation process, we will be growing our board and are committed to bringing on new members who are from diverse communities.
