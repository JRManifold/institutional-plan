### School-Wide Communication:

The way we communicate with our entire student body is critical.

**Student All Hands [Owner: Michelle]:** All Hands is designed to share information with the entire student body regarding school-wide announcements, important reminders/updates, learn about upcoming events, and hear from students/staff about cool projects they're working on! Q&A and shout-outs also included! All Hands occurs once a term and is usually the first week of the term.

**Town Halls [Owner: College Team, Anne]:** Space for students to share concerns on specific topics. Currently scheduled on an ad hoc basis. This has been facilitated by both College Team staff members. Town Halls result in identifying solutions to a particular topic / solve a problem(s) and is owned by the Dean.

**Slack / Email / Meetings [Owner: College Team]: **We primarily use slack to communicate with students. Students are expected to check their slack messages at least once a day, along with their email for school-wide updates and calendar invites for classes, coaching meetings, events, etc. Every Monday, we send an Important Announcements email outlining key dates, initiatives, and upcoming events students should be aware of.


### Security:

**Campus (555 Post Street, San Francisco):**
Safety is important to us. When on campus, all students and staff members use an ID card to badge into the building. This ensures that everyone walking in is part of our community and we are able to visually identify who enters.

Guests visiting campus press the doorbell (located directly next to the door) and their contact will let them in the building. They will then sign in using an IPad to verify their identity.

We previously had Student Receptionists, as well as a Security Guard as other means of safety precautions to not only greet folks as they walk in, but to also ensure anyone within the radius of the front door of Make School who enters is invited to do so.

On an annual basis, we will train all staff & new hires on our security and emergency protocols, including how to respond to security breaches.

We are currently in the process of developing an “Emergency” page on our website, in which students, staff, and their families can receive updates on emergencies that may impact our campus, including our campus housing. All community members are encouraged to [sign up for our text alert system](https://mobile-text-alerts.com/subscribe/MakeSchoolAlert), in which they can receive live-time emergency and security updates.

**851 California Street: ** Some students live in 851. There is a security guard monitoring the building every day from 10:30pm-6:30am PST.

**Herbert Hotel:**
Some students live in the Herbert Hotel. There’s limited front desk hours there.

### Health Insurance:

We are aware that health insurance is a significant need for many of our students and are actively working to determine how to better support students in accessing health care. We will soon be assigning a staff member to take on this project and explore both short-term and long-term solutions. As of right now, we want to better understand why students are not qualifying for MediCal and determine if we need to change the terms of the ISA model to allow students to utilize this option. Once we understand why students are not currently eligible, we will be able to create a 2-3 year plan to address this issue. Our ultimate goal is to have 100% of our students have regular access to health care.


### Mental Health:

Make School believes that mental health is a key component to student and staff success as well as overall well being. Therefore, we offer a free, unlimited resource to all students and staff: _BetterHelp_. To access, check your Make School email for a unique link created specifically for you. We want to offer this resource to everyone at Make School so that they can be better prepared for their personal and professional lives. BetterHelp is an online, on-demand resource that connects you with a licensed therapist through text message, phone and video chat via their desktop website or mobile app. Students received an invitation to their Make School email with a unique link to sign up, as well as a session during Orientation to outline more details about the services provided.
BetterHelp is 100% HIPAA compliant, which means legally your therapist cannot share anything you disclose during your session. The only exception to this is in the event you disclose that you are planning on harming yourself or others, and disclosures must happen in accordance with state law in which the therapist is practicing (which is why your location is important). Make School gets a monthly report of the number of people who are actively using BetterHelp for billing purposes, but we will never receive names, number sessions you attend, what you talk about with your therapist or other information related to your use of the service. _This is a confidential resource. _For questions about BetterHelp, reach out to [Lisa.Tran@makeschool.com](mailto:Lisa.Tran@makeschool.com).


### Title IX:

Title IX is a federal civil rights law passed as part of the Education Amendments of 1972. This law protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities. This includes protecting students from sexual misconduct: sexual harassment, intimate partner and domestic violence, stalking, nonconsensual sex or sexual contact, and retaliation based on unwillingness to participate in sexual acts or behaviors.

Make School is committed to providing a safe and supporting learning environment for all community members. To report incidents related to Title IX, academic difficulties, or other concerning behaviors, students may use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10F_jwgoiasmoJSAatMklao7en6U1nAP0EMbdufMwOF8/viewform?edit_requested=true&gxids=7628) to refer their peers or themselves to receive support services.  Please note that all information received in that form will remain private.  For questions regarding Title IX, reach out to [Adam@makeschool.com](mailto:Adam@makeschool.com).


### Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA):

The Americans with Disabilities Act provides those with a disability(s) access to the same rights and opportunities as everyone else.** **In order to receive services, students must fill out this [student intake form](http://make.sc/ada-intake-form) and meet with the ADA Coordinator to discuss reasonable accommodations based on the individual’s needs. The student will then provide instructor(s) with an electronic letter (via email) outlining the accommodations. For ADA questions or accommodations, reach out to [Giovanni@makeschool.com](mailto:Giovanni@makeschool.com).


### Housing:

We currently have students living in 851 California Street as well as Herbert Hall. Most students live in non-Make School affiliated housing. For questions regarding housing, contact [reslife@makeschool.com](mailto:reslife@makeschool.com).
