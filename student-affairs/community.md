# Overview

This strategy outlines the purpose, goals, tactics, and ideal outcomes of all community initiatives at Make School over the next twelve months. We’ll check in on this strategy weekly and make adjustments directly in doc.

----------

#  Purpose

The overarching vision is to empower our community to help break down barriers in the tech industry and collectively work towards a new generation of hyper-skilled humans, passionately driving towards positive change locally and globally.


# Strategy

We believe that we’ll be able to achieve this by putting most of our focus on creating inspiring, focused, and well-crafted events and content that bring in larger numbers of our target audience and community partners.



# Audience

  The following are subsets of the overall Make School community, with each group representing a percentage of our total reach. While each group will be instrumental in helping us reach our goals, we’ll focus all efforts on the target audience.


**Target Audience**

*Female and non-binary high-school juniors / seniors and first year college students interested in computer science.*

**Collaborators**
-   Students
-   Growth, College, and Ops teams
-   Event co-hosts
-   Values-aligned community partners

**Influencers**

# Organization Goals

Our long-term community goal is to proactively identify the leading contributors to members’ happiness, success, and brand perception, then design and execute creative, data-backed community-driven initiatives that we believe will positively influence each of these areas, using as few resources as possible.

We hope that by building community at Make School, we’ll be able to centralize feedback, connect members to mentors and resources, and generate stories that help acquire and inspire the next junior class.


# Success Metrics

Every team at Make School interacts with the community in a meaningful way and alignment with what they deem as community success is key. The table below outlines what we believe to be the most important qualitative and quantitative metrics to track the success of each team’s community goals.
