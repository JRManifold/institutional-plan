# Marketing

*Staff area owner and author: Simon Kronenberg (Director of Marketing)*

The role of Marketing at Make School is to generate awareness for the school, raise its reputation across the country and support the admissions team in attracting and enrolling new classes.

At the beginning of term one of 2021, the Marketing and Admissions team ran a survey with new enrollees as well as engaged applicants to ask for feedback on our marketing and our admissions processes. Based on the feedback, we created a set of key strategic goals for this admissions cycle. 



# Key strategic marketing goals for 2021 are:

  - Lowering marketing spend, measured as the average marketing spend per one enrollee
  - Placing more emphasis on engaging with High School students earlier (Junior and Sophomore year)
  - Ensuring Make School can be discovered organically on a variety of college platforms 
  - Placing more focus on events and initiatives specifically targeted to WomXn in tech
  - Improving and streamlining our core messaging to highlight a few key unique value propositions 
  - Redesigning the student referral process to make it more fun and rewarding to recommend Make School to friends 
  - PR around our innovative student financing solutions
