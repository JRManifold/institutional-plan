# Long Term Ideas

*Staff area owner and author: Ashu Desai (Founder)*

**We have a few ideas that we're interested in exploring in the mid-long term:**

- We're considering launching a fully online degree and creating an option for students who join the workforce early to complete their degree online.
- We'll look to add more specializations within computer science, such as design and human-computer interaction, robotics, and cognition and artificial intelligence. This will largely be determined based on student and employer demand.
- We'll look to create new majors beyond computer science, likely still computer adjacent. The leading contenders are computational biology and data science for climate.
- We'll look to build out a masters program to better serve older students.
- We'll look to teach computer science courses on campuses of more colleges (as we are at Dominican) to help modernize existing institutions.
- We're interested in building a campus in NYC to better serve students and employers on the east coast.
