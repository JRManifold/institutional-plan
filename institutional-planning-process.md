# How we define our strategic plan:

- Once every 2 years, the Leadership Team evaluates mid-term (3-5 year) objective with input from team members (via brainstorms) and the board of directors (via 1:1 conversations and board meetings). We are working to integrate student feedback into this process. This helps inform growth and financing plans with informal longer term plans.
- Every year during Q4, each team within the organization (ie. College, Growth, Operations, Engineering) produces a retrospective highlighting successes and challenges of the past year, along with opportunities for the coming year.
- Mid Q4, the leadership team uses these retrospectives to determine the strategic plan for the year at a 2 day offsite, highlighting an annual objective and key organization wide metrics.
- At the end of Q4, the leadership team presents the strategic plan to the team and board to ratify the plan.
- Simultaneously, individual teams work to finalize targets for each metric, and work with the finance department to produce an annual budget necessary to reach targets.
- The leadership team then evaluates each teamâ€™s budget wholistically as part of the entire organization budget and iterates to ensure this meets spending criteria.
- Progress and updates to the strategic plan are discussed quarterly at board meetings and with the team at State of the School presentations and town hall discussions. We are working to communicate this to students through bi-annual blog posts, State of the School presentations, and this repository.
