# Facilities Plan

### Staff area owner and author: Eric Deng (Business Operations Manager)

Below are quick bullet points on key areas of our building. It is important to note that while these are our current plans, we continually evaluate usage of space and emergent needs, and adjust plans or spaces accordingly to meet those needs, including potentially taking over additional facilities in the surrounding area to meet identified needs.

##Classrooms

###Ideal:
Completion of seven classrooms by August 2020 - classrooms are of various sizes, from about 20 person to 80 person rooms, including a larger classroom in the basement to facilitate simultaneous teaching of large class sections. Stonehenge is converted into additional staff space since the use of that space as a classroom has proven distracting for both students and instructors. After completion of these classrooms, this remains the primary classroom setup for the foreseeable future.

###Contingency:
Large classroom in the basement is not finished by August 2020, which means retaining some use of the ballroom as a large classroom, or needing to contract with close-by spaces to host larger sections that we are not able to accommodate on campus due to construction. Will be increased noise in surrounding classrooms and the ballroom as construction crews work to completion.

##Quiet space

###Ideal:
By August 2020, return of Mezzanine quiet study space by the windows, continued use of current first floor quiet work space/library, and continued use of smaller breakout-like rooms on the basement landing (with boxes and random items moved out!). After the development of these work spaces, this remains the primary quiet space setup for the foreseeable future.

###Contingency:
Current state - but Mezzanine spaces should open by the time students return from Spring Break.

##Lounge space

###Ideal:
By August 2020, fully opening the ballroom for usage as a lounge and gathering area. Shoe storage will be moved from the lobby and additional furniture staged there as well to facilitate additional lounge space. Patio space opened and available for use. This remains the lounge space setup for the foreseeable future.

###Contingency:
Current state - but we are planning to move shoe storage from the lobby to the ballroom landing over Spring Break to further develop the lobby space.

##Eating space + student kitchen 	

###Ideal:
By August 2020, students are able to access and use the student kitchen next to the Great Hall (and refrigerator), the student cafe/kitchenette in the ballroom, and the basement kitchenette. Dining tables will be setup in the student cafe area to increase the amount of eating space available. This remains the eating space and student kitchen access for the foreseeable future.

###Contingency:
Current state.

##Shoe storage

###Ideal & Contingency:
As highlighted in item 3 above (lounge space), we are planning to setup and move shoe storage from the lobby to the ballroom landing over Spring Break. As we grow, we will continue to evaluate shoe storage options and policies to ensure the efficient storage of shoes and the safety of students.

##Amount of pets in the building

###Ideal & Contingency:
We currently plan to continue the existing policies on Service Animal & Emotional Support Animals - these policies can be found in the Make School Student Handbook.

##Longer term campus plans

We plan to remain central in San Francisco and will look to rent space in nearby buildings as our student population grows.

Although San Francisco carries a high cost of living (among other challenges), we believe remaining in the city center increases access to economic opportunity for our students, along with opportunity to engage civically in a meaningful way. The improved career outcomes associated with being in San Francisco outweigh the costs.

We may look to find BART accessible student housing in Oakland to help address cost of living challenges. We are also prioritizing getting students access to Pell Grants to help lower cost of living burdens. Accessibility and student financing is a top concern for the institution.
