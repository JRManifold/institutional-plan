# Tuition and Financial Aid Plan

*Staff area owner and author: Eric Deng (Director of Finance and Operations)*

This section is WIP.

### Upcoming updates:

Week 2 of Term 4 - We will provide an update on Year 3 tuition. We are currently evaluating this based on the number of Seniors who are expected to take courses in Year 3.

Term 5 - We will provide an update on access to Title IV funding (Pell Grants and federally subsidized student loans) along with potential alternatives to Income Share Agreements.
