### **Financial Aid Options:**

U.S. Citizens and [eligible non-citizens](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility) will need to submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to apply for financial aid. Once your application is complete, you will receive an estimate of the aid you are eligible for. If the aid you are estimated to receive does not fully cover your cost of attendance (tuition and living expenses - see estimated costs at the bottom of [this page](https://www.makeschool.com/computer-science-degree/tuition-and-aid) under “Academic Year Budget”), you will need to apply for additional loans. 

If you are under 24 years of age, talk to your parents about submitting a Parent Plus loan. 

If you are over 24 years of age, submit applications for personal student loans. 

Make School is creating and funding an Extended Income-Based Repayment (EIBR) protection plan to cover Parent Plus and private loans to create full protection coverage for underemployed and unemployed graduates.

The EIBR protection plan is designed as an extension of the Federal IBR program to apply to all types of loans not covered by Federal IBR and preserve the protection and incentive alignment of Income Share Agreements. The EIBR protection plan will cap total student loan payments (combined federal direct, parent plus, and private), and more information can be found [here](https://www.makeschool.com/computer-science-degree/tuition-and-aid#eibr). 

We recommend sharing the above information on Make School’s EIBR plan with your parents in advance of them applying for a Parent Plus loan, or with your potential cosigners to help them understand the protections offered to you under this program. 

If you are denied or ineligible for a Parent Plus loan, and were denied from two separate lenders for personal student loans and do not have a cosigner, we will be working to increase your FAFSA amount and once that number is finalized, we will issue you an income share agreement (ISA) to sign to cover your remaining balance if you qualify.

See [this checklist](http://make.sc/finaid-checklist) for additional information regarding applying for loans. 

As your aid is processed, there will be additional steps you will need to take. These are dependent on your specific circumstances. For example, your FAFSA application may be tagged for verification, which will require you to submit additional documentation to validate the aid available to you. These items will need to be completed before we can finalize your award and send you your award letter. Another example is paperwork required by Dominican University to process your disbursements. Missing documents can be found in your [Dominican Financial Aid Portal](https://aid.dominican.edu/).

**You must complete all missing documents and take action on your financial aid award letter by the add/drop deadline for Term 1 for Fall disbursements (9/2/2020), or by the add/drop deadline for Term 3 for Spring disbursements (1/25/2020). If your financial aid items are not complete, a financial hold will be placed on your account. **

The sole financial aid offered to international students are ISAs. This aid is limited, and we work with students on a case by case basis to determine eligibility. 

For ISAs, we work with a partner (Vemo) who helps us manage contracts, signatures, and ultimately, payment and deferment processing. When a contract is generated for you to review and sign, an invitation will be sent to your personal email (from Vemo) that is on file with Make School. ISAs are processed after the application of financial aid.
