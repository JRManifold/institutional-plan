# Housing

*Staff area owner and author: Michelle Lessly Blackburn (Director of Student Affairs) : Interim - Anne Spalding (Dean)* 

Due to the pandemic, Make School reduced it's housing support to a minimum level for 2020-2021; maintaining housing for all existing students at our 851 California residence and offering some housing for incoming juniors through a partnership with Herbert Hotel. Social distancing, increased cleaning and other measures were put in place to maintain student safety.

In October 2020, due to student dissatisfaction with Herbert Hotel, students were given the opportunity to move into the 851 residence. In addition, due to the limited total number of students in housing, students in 851 were asked to consolidate so that a portion of the building can be leased to a third party.  Students impacted by these moves were also given a reduced rent.  

For next year, Make School is considering additional housing options with the presumption that we will be able to return to post-pandemic onsite delivery and housing.  We do not anticipate any additional housing being available before May 2021.
