We are providing all housing updates on #juniors-and-staff Slack Channel. Throughout February, we conducted a survey on housing and transportation needs (97% response rate). Data collection from that survey ended in the last week of February and was immediately used to inform the search process for new housing options for both rising seniors and incoming juniors. The data collected is as follows:

In response to location preference (choose all that apply):
77.9% are open to housing close to Make School (15-20 min. walk);
59.7% are open to housing farther from Make School (20-30 min. walk or transit);
39% are open to housing in Oakland;
33.8% are open to housing anywhere in San Francisco;
23.4% are open to housing in San Rafael (DU’s campus);
18.2% are open to housing anywhere in the area.

In response to Make School assistance with transit to/from housing (choose any all that apply):
90.9% are open to subsidized Muni pass/Clipper Card;
79.2% are open to group transit (e.g Make School buses);
50.65 are open to a cost-sharing model (Make School and students contribute a portion of the expense);
28.6% are open to a Living ISA option that’s specifically designed to cover transit;
3.9% reported not needing assistance with transit.

In response to how important of a factor is location (distance from Make School) in your decision 
to choose to live in Make School housing?
50.6% said it’s one of the top three or four factors 
24.7% said it’s important but not a deciding factor
19.5% said it’s the only thing they care about
3.9% said they can live anywhere
1.3% said nothing over a 40 minute commute using public transportation

In response to how important of a factor is Make School helping with transit in your decision to 
choose to live in Make School housing?:
57.1% said it’s one of the top three or four factors;
23.4% said it’s important but not a deciding factor;
14.3% said it’s the only thing they care about;
3.9% said they are willing to travel wherever for housing;
1.3% said access to transit is a quality of life issue.

In response to being willing to volunteer to help Make School with finding housing for students:
42.7% said they may be willing to help, but not now;
34.7% said they are not interested in helping to find housing;
22.7% said they would help Make School find housing.

Due to the results of the survey, Make School is focusing on securing housing that is within  a 15-20 minute walk of campus and are not pursuing options outside of that radius. As of early March, we have identified 9 properties within that radius and have conducted site visits of a number of those facilities. We are in the current stages of establishing working relationships and with the landlords/property owners of those buildings and starting the negotiating process to get price points within the same range as 851.

Once those stages are complete, we will invite students to take a look at the remaining properties and give us feedback which will play a significant role in the decision making process. Please note that the COVID-19 situation may impact the timing of this process.
