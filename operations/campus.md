# Campus Plan

*Staff area owner and author: Eric Deng (Director of Finance and Operations)*

Due to COVID-19 and initial shelter-in-place orders that were in effect for the City and County of San Francisco, construction in the building was paused in March, and remains paused at the time of this update.

We are following the city's updates for re-opening closely, and we are currently planning to identify what changes need to be made to our building to facilitate a return to the building in Summer or Fall 2021, if allowed by local authorities.

We are also following updates from the scientific community around the development of on-site rapid test as well as vaccines to help facilitate a safe return to campus.
