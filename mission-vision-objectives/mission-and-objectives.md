# Mission and Objectives

As an organization, we prioritize our work and innovation to support our mission, 3–5 year objective, and 2020 key metrics.

### Our mission is:
To create avenues of upward mobility for students of all backgrounds, empowering such students to contribute to society through science and technology innovation.

### Our 3–5 year objective is:
To build the largest, sustainable Computer Science bachelor's program in the country, with top quality outcomes, and a student body representative of America.

For context, the largest Computer Science programs in the country are 500-1000 students. Sustainable means we have financial stability and we aren't burning out our team. Top quality outcomes mean on par with top CS programs. A student body representative of America means our student demographics should reflect the demographics of 18-24 year olds in America.

### Our 2020 key metrics are:
- Placing 95% of our grads in jobs that average $90k+ annual salary
- 60 student Net Promoter Score (a measure of student satisfaction)
- Financial stability
- 60 team member Net Promoter Score (a measure of team satisfaction)
- 250 incoming students with 30% women and non-binary and 40% underrepresented students of color
- 30% of new hires and new board members to be underrepresented people of color, 50% to be women and non-binary

### Growth beyond 2020
We don't have a concrete student growth target beyond Fall 2020. We will evaluate our financial and operational constraints during our annual planning period this summer to establish a targets for 2021. We are aiming to balance our financial stability (which improves with a larger student body) with maintaining high student satisfaction and top quality outcomes.
