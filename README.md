# Make School Institutional Plan
A public repository communicating and tracking changes to Make School's institutional plan

*Staff project owner: Ashu Desai (Founder)*

### October 2020 update:

The October update is v0.5 of our Institutional Plan github. Our intention with this github is to create transparent documentation of Make School's "feature set" and future plans. We will use this repository in conjunction with our release cycle process (see "Institutional Planning Process") to provide regular updates to students and prospective students about how Make School is iterating and adapting.

We hope this creates more transparency and better information communication primarily with the student body and secondarily with the broader community. We also hope the github repository serves as a forum - alongside town-halls and feedback surveys - for students to contribute to the vision and development of our institution, an open-source, collaboratively built university.

It is an experiment for a college to provide documentation and allow for discussion in the format of a software project. We will learn along the way what works, what doesn't, and how to communicate more clearly and more efficiently. We hope by doing this we can hold ourselves to a higher standard of transparency, communication, and collaboration with our students, staff, prospective students, and broader community.

Our next update - which will provide more in-depth information across areas of the college - will be released the first week of December. Stay tuned!
